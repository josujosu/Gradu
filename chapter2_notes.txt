------------ ELLIPTICAL GALAXY SECTION --------------

BINNEY:

Surface brightness:

- I falls off smoothly with radius, until indistinguishable from BG sky
- R_e as measure of size, since no clear edge

Sérsic profile:

- n = 4 -> de Vaucouleurs profile
- b_m condition explanation

Rotation:

- massives, little to no rotation even in large ellipticity ellipticals
- dimmer, rotation and flattening correlated (Faber 1997)


- M/L ratio gained through dynamical modelling


MERRITT:

Sérsic profile:

- Popularity of Sérsic
  1. fits the profile of many individual galaxies over a wide range of R, usually the whole observed R
  2. fits into wide variety of galaxy types (Caon 1993 [68] in M)
- n=4, i.e. de Vaucouleurs is good representation of bright ellipticals

- deviations at large and small radii
- faints - cusp (NSC - nuclear stellar cluster) - disk-like, rescent star formation in gaseous disk?
- bright - core (deficit) - break radius 10 - 100 pc


CAPPELLARI 2016:

- Massive tend to rotate slowly
- Less massive faster

Sérsic:

- Capaccioli 1989 -> b(n) = 2n - 0.327

------------ ANALYSIS OF KINEMATICS SECTION --------------

BINNEY:

- velocities of stars can not be measured from far-away galaxies -> have to use v_los etc. to derive the kinematics (Doppler bradening)
