ELLIPTICAL GALAXIES:

- one sentence on what Es are
- Basic elliptical galaxy properties
- co-cetric ellipses -> Hubble classification -> eccentricity
- Surface brightness profiles
  - deVaucouleurs and Sérsic
- differences at small radii
  - type of difference depends on total luminosity
- luminosity affects other stuff too!
  - rotation, shape etc.
- basically two different types of Es (also Hubble classification of Es)
  - bright and dim


CORE GALAXIES:

- definition
- what is break radius
- different profiles (core Sér. and Nuker)

Core formation

- Explain mergers
- Evidence of binary SMBHs
- Scaling relations?


SLOW VS FAST ROTATORS (maybe part of IFU-chapter?):

- "already mentioned that slow and fast exist, but clear dichotomy"
- lambda
- ellipticity
- KDC?
