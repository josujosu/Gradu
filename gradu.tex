\chapter{Merger Simulations Using KETJU}

We analyse the results of two simulation sets of galaxy mergers with central supermassive black holes, both done using the KETJU code by \cite{Mannerkoski2019} and \cite{Rantala2018}. This is done in order to determine if merging SMBHs are able to cause the formation of cored galaxies, how the black hole masses affect the size of the core, and if the KETJU-code produces merger remnants comparable to observations. 

\section{Simulation Details}

All of the different simulation runs analysed, use merger progenitor galaxies from the same progenitor pool. There are seven different progenitors in total. Six of them (BH-1 - BH-6) contain central supermassive black holes, with the BH masses varying from $8.5 \times 10^8 M_\odot$ to $8.5 \times 10^9 M_\odot$. The seventh progenitor (BH-0) doesn't have an SMBH in its centre, and is included for the sake of comparison. The detailed masses of the progenitors' central SMBHs are listed in table \ref{table:progenitors}. Apart from the SMBH masses however, all of the progenitor galaxies have identical physical properties. These properties are described in table \ref{table:properties}, while the reasoning behind them is explained in \cite{Rantala2018} (do I have to go into same amount of detail as in the paper?).

Alongside the physical properties, the distributions of the different particles that make up the progenitor galaxies are also identical. Not counting the central point mass SMBH, all of the particles are distributed according to a Dehnen density-potential model \citep{Dehnen1993}:
\begin{equation}
\rho(r) = \frac{(3-\gamma)M}{4\pi} \frac{a}{r^\gamma (r+a)^{4-\gamma}},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\phi(r) = \frac{GM}{a} \times 
\begin{cases}
	-\frac{1}{2-\gamma} \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{r}{r+a} \right)^{2-\gamma} \right] & \; \gamma \neq 2 \\
	\ln \frac{r}{r+a}	 & \; \gamma = 2
\end{cases},
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the total mass, $a$ is a scaling radius, and $\gamma$ is the central slope of the profile. The fundamental difference between the models describing the distribution of the rest of the particles, i.e. stellar and dark matter particles, is that for stellar particles the value used for $\gamma$  is $3/2$, while for the dark matter particles $\gamma = 1$.

	$N_\star$: Number of stellar particles \\
	$N_\mathrm{DM}$: Number of dark matter particles}
	\label{table:properties}
\end{table}

While the merger progenitor galaxies are the same, the initial conditions of the simulations are quite different. The \cite{Mannerkoski2019} simulations comprise of four subsequent runs, where, initially the progenitor galaxy BH-6 (table \ref{table:progenitors}), and later the remnant of the previous merger, is merged with the progenitor BH-2. On the other hand, the simulations done by \cite{Rantala2018} contain simply seven different mergers between two of the same progenitor galaxies.

The results gathered from the two sets of simulations also differ from each other. From the simulations done by \cite{Mannerkoski2019}; the locations, velocities and masses of the central SMBHs are saved. The data comes from time steps starting from when the semi-major-axis of the merging SMBH binary is $a \lesssim 5000 R_s$ ($R_s$ is the Schwarzschild radius) up until the end of the simulation. The simulation results of \cite{Rantala2018}, however, consists of not only the properties of the black holes, but also the stellar particles and dark matter particles, in the form of a single snapshot at the simulation time $t = 2 \mathrm{Gyr}$. Due to the distinct difference between the type of results gained from the two different simulation sets (and for simplicity's sake), we will from now on be calling the simulations from \cite{Mannerkoski2019} "Runs", and the ones from \cite{Rantala2018} "Snapshots" (table \ref{table:runs_and_snaps}).

The orange and blue lines show the paths taken by the smaller and larger black holes respectively during the simulation. Both paths show clear spiral patterns which become smaller and smaller as the simulation proceeds. The paths end at the location where the black holes merge, i.e. where the distance between them is below the specific threshold.}

\end{figure}

\section{Core Size Measurements}

In order to check if a merger remnant is cored or not, we first have to calculate their surface brightness profiles. As the "Runs" don't contain stellar data, we use the "Snapshots" for the core analysis. 

We calculate the surface brightness profiles from the snapshots by: changing the coordinate system to centre-of-mass coordinates, projecting the stellar particles onto a plane, and calculating masses inside logarithmically space radial bins to get a radial mass surface density profile. We then do the aforementioned calculations 100 times from random viewing angles and calculate the azimuthal average of the profiles. This allows us to form a smooth mass surface density profile, which we then turn into a surface brightness profile by assuming a mass-to-light ratio of $M/L = 4$ \citep{Rantala2018}. In figure \ref{figure:surface_brightness}, one can see example surface brightness profiles for all of the snapshots. Looking at the different curves, it seems like the presence of central SMBHs in the progenitor galaxies does cause some kind of brightness deficiency near the galactic centre of the remnant's surface brightness profile. Not only that, the higher the mass of the central black holes in the progenitor galaxies, the larger the surface brightness deficiency seems to be.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{SurfaceBrightnessProfiles.png}
	\caption{Surface brightness profiles of all of the simulated merger remnants. The profiles were calculated by dividing the remnants into 100 radial bins, and averaging the surface brightness inside the bins through 100 random viewing angles. The luminosity of the particles was estimated by assuming a mass-to-light ratio of $M/L = 4$.}
	\label{figure:surface_brightness}
\end{figure}

The surface brightness profiles mentioned above do seem to indicate the presence of cores in the merger remnants with merging SMBH binaries. Determining the precise size of the core requires us to find the exact location where the deviations from the expected power-law profile start. This can be done by fitting the calculated profile with a model that is a combination of two power laws, a shallow inner power-law and steeper outer power-law. The location where the power laws change, i.e. the break radius $r_b$ is the radius of the core. 

There are two commonly used options for modelling the surface brightnes profiles. The first one is the core-Sérsic profile \citep{Graham2003}, which can be expressed using the following equation:
\begin{equation}
\mu(r) = \mu' \left[ 1 + \left( \frac{r_b}{r} \right)^\alpha \right]^{\gamma / \alpha} \exp \left\lbrace -b_n \left[ \left( r^\alpha + r_b^\alpha \right) / r_e^\alpha \right]^{1/(\alpha n)} \right\rbrace, \label{eq:core-sersic}
\end{equation}
where $r_b$ is the break radius (i.e. the core radius), $\gamma$ is the logarithmic slope of the inner power-law, $\alpha$ controls the sharpness of the transition between the two power-laws, $r_e$ and $n$ are the effective half-mass radius and the Sérsic index of the outer power-law, and the normalization factor $\mu'$ is defined by:
\begin{equation}
\mu' = \mu_b 2^{-\gamma/\alpha} \exp \left[ b_n \left( 2^(1/\alpha) r_b/r_e \right)^{1/n} \right], 
\label{eq:mu_dot}
\end{equation}
where $\mu_b$ is the surface brightness at the break radius. 

The second option for determining the core radius through profile fitting, is using the so called Nuker profile \citep{Lauer1995}:
\begin{equation}
\mu(r) = 2^{(\beta - \gamma) / \alpha} \mu_b \left( \frac{r_b}{r} \right)^\gamma \left[ 1 + \left( \frac{r}{r_b} \right)^\alpha \right]^{(\gamma - \beta)/\alpha},
\label{eq:nuker}
\end{equation}
where $r_b$ is once again the break radius (core radius), $\mu_b$ is the surface brightness at the core radius, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are the logarithmic slopes of the power-laws inside and outside of the break radius respectively, and $\alpha$ is the sharpness of the transition between the two slopes.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{core_nuker_fits.png}
	\caption{Core-Sérsic and Nuker profile fits of surface brightness profiles calculated from Snapshot 3 (top-left and top-right figures). The best fit parameters are written on the figures, and are in the same units as the axes (i.e. $r_b$ and $R_e$ in kilo-parsecs, and $\mu_b$ in V-band magnitudes per arc-second squared). The relative residuals of the fits are plotted under their respective figures. The delta describes the root-mean-square of the residuals.}
	\label{figure:core_nuker}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{figure:core_nuker} shows both core-Sérsic ad Nuker fits of the surface brightness profile of snapshot 3 (refer to table \ref{table:runs_and_snaps}). The values of the best-fit parameters are written on the figure, and looking at them, it is clear that the exact value of the break radius, i.e. the core radius, depends quite heavily on the model used.

It is also possible to estimate the size of the core without model fitting by using the so-called "cusp radius", which is the radius at which the logarithmic slope of the surface brightness density $\gamma' = 1/2$ \citep{Carollo1997, Lauer2007Cusp}.

The progenitors of the top-left simulation contained $8.5 \times 10^8 M_\odot$ mass central SMBHs, and $8.5 \times 10^9 M_\odot$ mass central SMBHs in the top-right simulation. The parameters for NGC1600's profile (bottom right), are changed from the units used by \cite{Thomas2016} to the above by assuming $V - R = 0.5$ (the same assumption being done by \cite{Lauer2007}), and by using the distance $D = 64 \mathrm{Mpc}$ \citep{Thomas2016} in order to define the relation between arc seconds and parsecs. As one can see, the profiles gained from simulations and observations are quite similar to each other.}
