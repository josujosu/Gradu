CHAPTER 1:

- Historical context
  - discovery of galaxies (1 sentence maybe)
  - Hubble classification
  - Elliptical galaxies
  - initially thought to be homogeneous objects
  - later on (?) photometric/kinematic properties coupled with luminosity
  - though to be consequenco of different formation methods

  - core galaxies part of brights (Ferrarese, Lauer, Kormendy)
  - describe formation
  - SMBHs thought to be common

- Numerical Simulations
  - need numerical simulations to test theories, we can only see what equates to a snapshot of the Universe in our lifetime
  - Holmberg 1941
    - simulated whether loss of energy via tidal disturbances causes clustering 
    - light bulbs - photocell - mass replaced by light
  - N-body codes
    - von Hoerner
    - Aarseth (NBODY series of codes)
    - regularisation (KS)
    - AR-CHAIN
  - more efficient codes
    - Appel and Barnes & Hut (1985 and 1986)
    - GADGET
  - need combination of previous codes
  - talk about KETJU

- aims of thesis
  - determine whether core galaxies are formed as a result of SMBH mergers through analysing simulation data from KETJU


---------- NEW PLAN -----------

- Historical context

- even during early when Es were though to be a homogeneous class of galaxies, it was known that there are Es with flat core profiles and steep profiles
- werent known if this was the result of atmospherical interference
- Hubble Space Telescope
- comparing land observations and HST, Ferrarese 1994 found type I and type II
- something that looks like a dichotomy -> different evolutionary paths
- CDM cosmology assumes mergers
- black holes have been found to affect evolution
- SMBHs might eject stars from the centre
-> current formation theory: massive gas-poor Es with central SMBHs
   - lack of gas -> slow rotation, no cenral star formation
   - SMBH binary -> ejection of stars
- formation theories cant be observed
  - find time it takes for Antennae galaxy to merge
  - need other methods 

- Numerical Simulations
  WRITE IN CONTEXT OF SIMULATIONS OF GALAXY FORMATION AND ESPECIALLY CORE FORMATION
  - need numerical simulations to test theories, we can only see what equates to a snapshot of the Universe in our lifetime
  - even in 1940s
  - Holmberg 1941
    - simulated whether loss of energy via tidal disturbances causes clustering 
    - light bulbs - photocell - mass replaced by light
  - N-body codes
    - von Hoerner
    - Aarseth (NBODY series of codes)
    - regularisation (KS)
    - AR-CHAIN
  - more efficient codes
    - Appel and Barnes & Hut (1985 and 1986)
    - GADGET
  - core simulations require both high efficiency and precision
  - often efficiency comes in expense of precision
  - need combination of previous codes
  - regularised tree codes
  - talk about KETJU

- aims of thesis
  - determine whether core galaxies are formed as a result of SMBH mergers through analysing simulation data from KETJU


Binney (1982) - smaller central consentration probably caused by being less resolved due to large distance
