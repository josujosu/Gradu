CHAPTER 3:

- KETJU 
  - designed for simulating global galactic dynamics
  - combination of tree-code and an algorithmic regularization method
  - allows for the simulation of both general galactic dynamics and prceise gravitational interactions near SMBHs

3.1 AR-CHAIN

- three parts:
  - regularization with time change and leapfrog integration
  - chain formation to combat roundoff error
  - bulrisch-stoer extrapolation method for increased accuracy

3.2 GADGET-3

- tree-codes
  - more efficient than N-body codes, NlnN scaling
  - G3 contains both tree and particle mesh codes, but PM not useful enough in galactic-scale simulations (Binney)

- Formation and use of tree structure
  - explain tree-formation and how to use cells (Binney)
  - multipole expansion (Binney)
    - GADGET-3 uses only the monopole expansion (sum of masses, Springel2005)

- softened dynamics
  - Plummer softening
  - softening kernel W_2 (väitöskirja, Springel2005?)

3.3 Combined Functionality

- Chain subsystem
  - selection criterion
  - macro particle in tree code
  - perturber particles
  - merging / ejecting particles

- time steps
  - adaptive and individual time steps
  - GADGET-3 steps dependent on accel.
  - SMBHs in smallest time-step level, ejected particles smallest tree time-step level
  
- SMBH mergers (3.4)
  - safety factor
  - coalescence timescale
  - minimum separations
  - properties after merger
