CHAPTER 2:

2.1 Elliptical galaxies (Galaxy formation and evolution)

- Definition
- Mention ETGs (Cappellari 2016)
  - Explain lenticulars
  - Hubble classification
  - No spiral

(Rantala and Lahén, GFE, cappellari 2016)

Surface brightness

- surface brightness profiles
  - Sérsic-profile
- Core - Power-law - Cuspy galaxies
- luminosity difference
- boxy / disky isophotes

Kinematics (GFE)

- disky rotate fast / boxy rotate slowly
  -> flatness of diskys caused by rotational flattening. for boxys anisotropic velocity distribution
- triaxial (for boxy) and axisymmetric (for disky) potentials
- KDC seen in boxy
- velocity dispersion rise near centre -> shows existence of BH (GFE)

Formation

- Hierarchical formation
- Differences in formation of cuspys and cores
  - cuspy: in-situ star formation - gas-rich mergers
  - core: in-situ star formation -> "dry" mergers

2.2 Core Galaxies

Definition
- inner slope < 0.3 (Lauer 1995)
- shallow inner profile, seep outer (Kormendy and Bender 1999)

Surface brightness profiles
- stuff from chapter 2

Core Formation

- BH mergers (Merritt chapter 8, Faber 1997, Quinlan & Hernquist 1997, Milosavljevic 2002)
  - three phases
    - hard binary: binary SMBH whose relative velocity >> field star velocity
    - final-parsec problem (Milosavljevic, 2003)
    - loss-cone (repopulation mechanisms: triaxial, Merritt 446 and 452)
  - Evidence:
    - SMBH scaling relations (Merritt 2010)
      - BH-mass - mass deficit relation - evidence of SMBHs causing cores (Merritt 2006, Graham 2004, Dullo 2014)
      - BH-mass - R_b relation also (Dullo 2012)
      - scaling relations might provide evidence for coevolution (though maybe not) (Kormendy 2013)
    - observations of binary SMBHs (Merritt, Abbott 2016 GW-observations)
  


2.3/2.4 Galactic Dynamics

Potential theory
- Poisson equation (BT)
- Density-Potential models, Dehnen

Collisionless systems (Merritt)
- phase space
  - Vlasov equation - collisionless Boltzmano
  - conservation of number density f

Regularisation

PN-dynamics (Mora 2004, Merritt)
- spin parameters dont come out at any PN-order, because basic PN-terms assume point masses

2.3/2.4 Integral Field Spectroscopy

- modified gaussian function
- hermite polynomials
  - GFE: Gauss-Hermite polynomials used because LOSVD not perfectly Gaussian
- slow vs fast rotators (Emsellem 2011)
  - lambda-parameter
