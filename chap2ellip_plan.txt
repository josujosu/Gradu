ELLIPTICAL GALAXIES:

- one sentence on what Es are
- Basic elliptical galaxy properties
- co-cetric ellipses -> Hubble classification -> eccentricity
- Surface brightness profiles
  - deVaucouleurs and Sérsic
- differences at small radii
  - type of difference depends on total luminosity
- luminosity affects other stuff too!
  - rotation, shape etc.
- basically two different types of Es (also Hubble classification of Es)
  - bright and dim

- formation:
  - cuspy:
    - accumulation of gas: mihos 1994 ja hopkins
    - Barnes & Hernquist: gas that accumulates in the centre changes the potential (-> larger velocity dispersion, i.e. faster rotation)
    - Naab 2006: collisionless simulations without gas -> boxy isophotes; gas in simultions -> elliptical or even disky shapes
      - steep central potential caused by gas doesn't allow for box orbits 
    - Naab & Ostriker 2017: Extra-light caused by inflow of gas resulting in starburst
  - core:
    Massive galaxies:
    - Naab 2006: ETG mergers play important part at late evolution
    - Naab 2009: in-situ star firmation z > 2
    Core galaxies:

CORE GALAXIES:

- definition
- what is break radius
- different profiles (core Sér. and Nuker)

Core formation

- Explain mergers
- Evidence of binary SMBHs
- Scaling relations?


SLOW VS FAST ROTATORS (maybe part of IFU-chapter?):

- "already mentioned that slow and fast exist, but clear dichotomy"
- lambda
- ellipticity
- KDC?
